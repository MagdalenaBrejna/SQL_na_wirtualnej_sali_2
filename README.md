## About

The SQL_na_wirtualnej_sali_2 contains the second task solved during the final exam on the SQL course organised by SKNI (April-May 2020). The solution lets select the lowest 
salary in the cities from hr database (Oracle). Salaries are counted for employees who fill all conditions given in the task.

The solution joins tables: employees, locations, countries and departments to gather information about hire date, department id, country name, city name and salary. The final
table contains minimum salary for every city and country. During the selection it skips departments which are not included in the four most largest departments and people who work shorter than the employee who works at vary least in the largest department.
